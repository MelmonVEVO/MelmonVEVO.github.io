            <p>Hello, I'm Dylan!</p>
            <p>I'm a programmer who graduated from the University of Bath. I have an interest in web dev and artificial intelligence. I mainly use Python and Typescript in my projects, however I do have experience in other languages like Haskell and C. Additionally, I like to partake in competitive programming to develop my skills. On the side, I like to work on games with Godot.</p>
			<p>Other than that, I also like exploring Linux, playing tabletop and computer games, clay pigeon shooting, studying Japanese, playing piano or picking up anything else that catches my fancy!</p>
