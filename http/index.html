            <p>I'm Dylan.</p>
            <p>I currently a finalist Computer Science student <a href="https://people.bath.ac.uk/dgd29/">at the University of Bath</a>. I love programming. I mainly use Python and Typescript in my university and personal projects, however I do have experience in other languages like Haskell and C. Additionally, I like to partake in competitive programming and hackathons to develop my skills. On the side, I like to work on games with Unity and Godot.</p>
            <p>I also have an interest in the fields of artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning and deep learning. I am currently writing my dissertation on deep reinforcement learning agents to play the video game Rogue.</p>
			<p>Other than that nerd stuff, I also like exploring Linux, playing tabletop and computer games, clay pigeon shooting, archery, studying Japanese, baking or picking up anything else that catches my fancy!</p>
