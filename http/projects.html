            <h2>chizuru-rogue</h2>
            <h4>AI - May 2023</h4>
            <p>This was originally created to supplement my BSc Computer Science dissertation, but I have been remaking it since (coming soon!). It is a machine learning artificial intelligence with a customised neural network that plays the classic video game Rogue.</p>
            <p>The source code is available on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~melmon/chizuru">Sourcehut</a>.

            <h2>@channel</h2>
            <h4>Web app - June 2021</h4>
            <p>This is a simple message board app written in Flask and Python. Currently supports creating boards, threads and replies, currently working on more advanced features such as markdown and replying to a specific post.</p>
            <p>The source code is maintained on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~melmon/at-channel">Sourcehut</a>.

            <h2>Robbin Food</h2>
            <h4>Game - April 2021</h4>
            <p>This is a small game made in Unity in under 24 hours for the Bath Hack 2021 hackathon, in which I helped out with a good portion of the programming and logo design. It was created by me, Hannah Khan, Nara Smajic and Tom Goldsmith.</p>
            <p>It is a game where you move around a city, collecting dropped food items while simultaneously trying not to be spotted and caught by bad guys.</p>
            <p><del>You can play the game <a href="https://projects.melmon.dev/robbin-food/">here</a></del> <strong>(Page is broken for now, but I'm working on it!)</strong> and see the original post <a href="https://devpost.com/software/robbin-food">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>Connect Four with AI</h2>
            <h4>Other thing - 2019</h4>
            <p>This was a game that I created for A-Level Computer Science. It is a connect four game written in Python that lets users play against other users or bots. The bots run on the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, a heuristic searching algorithm based on simulating future games.</p>
            <p>The code can be found <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~melmon/c4ai">here</a>.</p>
