            <p>Hello, I'm Dylan!</p>
            <p>I'm a programmer who graduated from the University of Bath. I have an interest in game development, web development and artificial intelligence. I mainly use Python and Typescript in my projects, however I do have experience in other languages like C. Additionally, I like to participate in game jams, mainly using the Godot game engine.</p>
			<p>Other than that, I also like home server management, playing tabletop and computer games, clay pigeon shooting, producing music, playing piano or picking up anything else that catches my fancy!</p>
