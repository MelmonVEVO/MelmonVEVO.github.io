      <p>Hello, I'm Dylan!</p>
      <p>
        I'm a programmer who graduated from the University of Bath. I have an
        interest in game development, web development and artificial
        intelligence. I mainly use C and Zig for personal projects, and
        TypeScript at my job. Additionally, I like to participate in game jams
        using raylib or the Godot game engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than that, I also like reading (mainly thriller and magical
        realism), tabletop games, clay pigeon shooting, playing piano and guitar
        or picking up anything else that catches my fancy.
