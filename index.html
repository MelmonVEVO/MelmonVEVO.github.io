            <p>Hello! I'm Dylan. Welcome to my website!</p>
            <p>I currently study Computer Science <a href="https://people.bath.ac.uk/dgd29/">at the University of Bath</a> and I love programming. I mainly use Python and Typescript in my university and personal projects, however I do dabble in other languages like Haskell and C. Additionally, I like to partake in competitive programming and hackathons to develop my skills. On the side, I like to work on games with Unity and Godot.</p>
            <p>Other than software development, I also like exploring Linux with a Thinkpad, video editing, playing tabletop and computer games, studying Japanese, baking or picking up anything else that catches my fancy!</p>
