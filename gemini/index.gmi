I mainly use Python and Typescript in my university and personal projects, however I do have experience in other languages like Haskell and C. Additionally, I like to partake in competitive programming and hackathons to develop my skills. On the side, I like to work on games with Unity and Godot.I also have an interest in the fields of artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning and deep learning. I am currently writing my dissertation on deep reinforcement learning agents to play the video game Rogue.Other than that nerd stuff, I also like exploring Linux, playing tabletop and computer games, clay pigeon shooting, archery, studying Japanese, baking or picking up anything else that catches my fancy!
