I mainly use Python and Typescript in my university and personal projects, however I do dabble in other languages like Haskell and C. Additionally, I like to partake in competitive programming and hackathons to develop my skills. On the side, I like to work on games with Unity and Godot.=> https://melmon.dev/ Main websiteOther than software development, I like to pass the time by video editing, playing tabletop and computer games, studying Japanese, baking or picking up anything else that catches my fancy!=> gemini://melmon.dev/projects.gmi Projects=> gemini://melmon.dev/contact.gmi Contact me
